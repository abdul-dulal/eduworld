          We are happy to introduce the new Lawson Collection. These are three
          quartz models designed with <br /> simplicity and elegance kept in
          mind. They come in different sizes and colors, and all feature a
          stainless <br />
          steel back â€” leaving enough space for a personalized engraving. The
          engraving service is complimentary <br /> with any watch from the
          Lawson series.
